# Nav

A basic component for rendering a list of links as a nav

## Known Issues

The display prop is currently not working as intended. The stylesheet is preventing display-none from hidding the content when the viewport is greater than `$view-breakpoint-3` - some refactoring is required to correct this issue while not affecting current usage.
